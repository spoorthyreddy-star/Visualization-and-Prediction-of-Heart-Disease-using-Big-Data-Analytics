# Heart Disease Prediction and Visualization using Big Data Analytics

This project focuses on leveraging Big Data techniques for the **visualization and prediction of heart disease**, inspired by the research presented by Ashutosh Shankhdhar at the IEEE SMART–2022 conference.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- To analyze heart disease datasets using Big Data tools.
- To visualize key health indicators using modern data visualization libraries.
- To build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict the presence of heart disease.

## 🔍 Dataset

I used a heart disease dataset . The dataset contains features such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Rest ECG
- Max Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- Oldpeak (ST depression)
- ST Slope
- Target (Presence or absence of heart disease)

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python
- **Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Big Data Tools:** PySpark (or Pandas if not Spark-based)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Model(s):** Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Stacking CV Classifier, XG Boost, KNN, SVM Classifier

## 📊 Visualizations

I included visual insights such as:

- Distribution of health attributes
- Class imbalance of heart disease presence

## 🤖 Model Performance

The model(s) were evaluated using metrics like:

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## 🏁 Results & Insights

- Key health indicators contributing to heart disease prediction were identified.
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **99%** (fill in based on your output).
- Visualizations provided a clearer understanding of risk factors.
